# Computational analysis of DNMT3L in mammalian oocytes
This repository contains the document of the project "DNMT3L in mammalian oocytes" which marks the author's scientific work under University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice.
It delves into the computational analysis of DNMT methyltransferases, with a particular focus on DNMT3L. Various tools were developed or employed in order to analyze genetic data pertaining to DNMT genes and associated gene-encoding proteins. The project can only be previewed briefly with majority of the work not available for preview due to regulations and policies of the university. For further interest into the full project and its scientific findings, we encourage you to contact the author.
