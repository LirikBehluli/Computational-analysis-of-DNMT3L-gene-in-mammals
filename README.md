# Computational analysis of DNMT3L in mammalian oocytes
This document contains the project "DNMT3L in mammalian oocytes" which marks scientific work of the author under University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice.
It dives into computational analysis of DNMT methyltransferases and specifically DNMT3L. Several tools were created or employed in order to analyze genetic data about DNMT genes as well as associated gene-encoding proteins. The project can only be previewed briefly; for further interest into the full picture and scientific results you can contact the author.
